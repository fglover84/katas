# sounds-polaris-cc-kata

Repo for shared TypeScript kata session between Polaris and Common Catalogue.

After each session, feel free to commit and push your files.

# usage

Create a file in the correct year folder (e.g. src/2022) named _current_month_-_team member name_.ts with a corresponding test file in /test

- e.g. src/2022/november-michael.ts & test/2022/november-michael.test.ts

pnpm i
pnpm t test-name.test.ts

Note - this has been tested using tooling we currently support in Polaris e.g. pnpm6, node 14 (16 works too here). It may work with other versions but hasn't been tested!
