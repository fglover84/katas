Santa Claus will choose half the children to achieve their maximum wishes, and the other half to achieve their minimum wishes. 
Please calculate, how many gifts do Santa Claus need at least. In accordance with the above example, the results should be:

All elements of wishes always be positive integers.
You can assume that the minimum wish is always less than or equals to maximum wish.
You can assume that the array length is always an even number.
